# Fake News Classifier
 Check if a news article is real or fake.

 ## General Info

 This project used BERT to classify news articles on two classes. Fake or real? A model pre-trained on the CoLA (The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability) corpus, and later fine tuned using a dataset containing real and fake news articles. 

 Google's toolset was used to save time.
